            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>What! is the <hi>City</hi> run out of the <hi>Gates?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Ye fly like Eagles on the Wings of Wealth,</l>
               <l>To overtake Your Prey afar off, Health:</l>
               <l>As if whoever could but get away,</l>
               <l>Had his Life given to Him for a Prey.</l>
               <l>Go, leave the City; do, and Post ye hence,</l>
               <l>From the sad Centre to th' Circumference.</l>
               <l>The Rocks, and Mountains, and the Paths untrod</l>
               <l>Cannot conceal ye from the Eyes of God.</l>
               <l>Why fly ye then? Is not the Lord, think you,</l>
               <l>God of the Hills, and of the Valleys too?</l>
               <l>Durst ye not trust the Lord in Your behalves,</l>

               <l>Is it for this, You to the Hills repair,</l>
               <l>To sacrifice unto the Prince of th' Air,</l>
               <l>Gaping for Air as every One were gone,</l>

               <l>'Tis like too many did their Trades adjourn,</l>

               <l>And, though his Hand th' avenging Angel stop,</l>
               <l>Are still afraid to come to the <hi>Old Shop.</hi>

               <l>These Men are sentenc'd to a double doom,</l>
               <l>Come Health, or Sicknesse, still the Plague's at Home;</l>
               <l>For they can Whet their Knives at better rate</l>
               <l>On a Cartwheel, than at the <hi>Compter-Gate.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To such I must confesse a Plague will be,</l>
               <l>Not a Disease, but a Recovery:</l>
               <l>They must have needs shut up and hid the Head,</l>
               <l>Though not with Plague, they had been Visited:</l>
               <l>For Death and Debt they fear on equal score;</l>
               <l>But they are gone, and shall be seen no more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Doctors think too, (whom I therefore mention)</l>
               <l>A Journey now, good <hi>Physick for prevention.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who, when they see Contagion in such force,</l>

               <l>Whose <hi>Excellencies</hi> from the foot-cloth-rank.</l>
               <l>Into the Country sneak to <hi>Mount-a-bank.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Pure <hi>Visitants</hi> they are, to shun Heav'ns Rod,</l>
               <l>Leave their Poor Patients <hi>Visited</hi> of God:</l>
               <l>To whom they rid (as now too plain 'tis shown)</l>
               <l>Not to Cure their Diseases, hut their own:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Fee</hi> they like well, that, alass, is sweet,</l>
               <l>But the Destroying <hi>Angel</hi> fear to meet.</l>
               <l>But here's enough to speak of them, for I</l>
               <l>Count this is just <hi>Religio Medici.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This yet is greater, and it makes me sad,</l>
               <l>Most of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>'s run to <hi>Gad.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Appeased Heaven, 'tis like, this Plague might stay,</l>
               <l>Did every <hi>Phinehas</hi> but stand up and Pray;</l>
               <l>Too many now are of their Priests bereft,</l>
               <l>And but the meanest of the People left.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Parson</hi> is (I know not of whose giving)</l>
               <l>Into the <hi>Country</hi> gone, to get a <hi>Living.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>How can we in our Heavenly course but stray,</l>
               <l>When those should guide Us thither, run away?</l>
               <l>They bid Us kneel when Heaven afflicts; not fly,</l>
               <l>And give their Doctrine (in their Deeds) the lye.</l>
               <l>As if our Errors (like Old <hi>Eli's</hi> Vice)</l>
               <l>Could never be atton'd by Sacrifice.</l>
               <l>Once said a Zealous Priest, <hi>Now Soldiers Fight;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Who dyes to day, shall sup with Christ at Night:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A Pistol streight to the Priests Breast was set,</l>
               <l>Who cries, Pray Sir, I am not hungry yet.</l>
               <l>Too many thus with <hi>Canaan's</hi> Language stalk</l>
               <l>For their own ends; and make Gods Word meer talk.</l>
               <l>It follows then, their flight this wrong hath done us;</l>
               <l>Gods House shut up, and <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If still the <hi>Livite</hi> be resolv'd to fly?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Go thy way for a Church-man,</hi> then say I.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Lastly, when <hi>Sion</hi> has a Cause to <hi>Mourn,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>God does not bid Us <hi>ramble,</hi> but <hi>return.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> has told Us in <hi>Times past,</hi>

               </l>
               <l>Then let us turn, and not our sins conceal,</l>
               <l>That Hand that Wounded Us, can only heal;</l>
               <l>Nothing can Cure Us of our Maladies,</l>
